# Venus - Simplified Profile Management

## Project Overview
*Venus* is a platform designed to streamline the process of sharing digital CVs and important professional and social media links. We aim to address a common problem faced by job applicantsâ€”employers find it tedious to manually type links from printed CVs into their browsers. With Venus, users can create a simple, centralized profile that houses their CV and important links, making it easier for employers to access all necessary information with a simple search.

### Key Features:
- *Profile Creation*: Users can create an account and manage their profile easily.
- *Link Integration*: Users can add links to their social media platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, Facebook, and more.
- *Searchable Usernames*: Profiles can be found using a username search on the homepage, which can be included in a CV or resume for easy access.
- *Privacy Control*: Users can choose whether their profile is public or private based on their preference.
